PhysioAI: AI-Powered Movement Analysis for Enhanced Physiotherapy
MongoDB AI Hackathon Project Proposal

Executive Summary
PhysioAI is an innovative medical diagnosis tool that combines advanced sensor technology, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing to revolutionize physiotherapy practices. By leveraging MongoDB Atlas, Amazon Bedrock, and machine learning, the system provides physiotherapists with data-driven insights for improved patient diagnosis and treatment planning.

Problem Statement
Traditional physiotherapy assessment relies heavily on subjective observations and manual measurements, which can lead to:
- Inconsistent diagnosis across different practitioners
- Difficulty in tracking subtle changes in patient movement patterns
- Limited ability to quantify patient progress
- Challenges in maintaining detailed historical records of movement analysis
- Time-consuming documentation and analysis processes

Proposed Solution
PhysioAI addresses these challenges through an integrated system that combines:
1. Real-time movement analysis using sensor data
2. AI-powered diagnostic recommendations
3. Comprehensive patient progress tracking
4. Data-driven insights for treatment optimization
